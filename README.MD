HOW TO RUN

1. Open the project using Xcode
2. Select a device (iPad is recommended) and hit the run button

### Getting started

1. Add tokens to the field by tapping or dragging
2. Tokens can be customized by rotating the wheel, typing a name or changing the color
3. When the field is full hit the start button
4. Type in a score (such as 0 to 0 at the beginning of a game) to start the timer
5. When the timer expires a random player will be chosen to answer a trivia question
6. If answered correctly the player can drag one of their tokens to a better square
