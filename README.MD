### About ###

An iOS app with a new twist on football squares. Answer trivia correctly and move to a better square.

This game was created using the following technologies:

* Objecive-C programming language
* AVFoundation framework
* UIKit framework
* QuartzCore framework
* Core Animation framework
* Xcode IDE 

If you're interested in writing a Core Data persistence store, or if you have any other contributions you'd like to make,  please contact me. Collaboration to improve the game would be great!
  
### How to Run ###

1. Open the project using Xcode
2. Select a device (iPad is recommended) and hit the run button

### Getting started

1. Add tokens to the field by tapping or dragging
2. Tokens can be customized by rotating the wheel, typing a name or changing the color
3. When the field is full hit the start button
4. Type in a score (such as 0 to 0 at the beginning of a game) to start the timer
5. When the timer expires a random player will be chosen to answer a trivia question
6. If answered correctly the player can drag one of their tokens to a better square
